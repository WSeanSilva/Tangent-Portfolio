# Tangent-Portfolio

I developed a Python project that generated tangent portfolios using the yfinance library. This program allows users
to customize the risk-free rate, either through manual input or automated calculation using online data. Users are
able to also select the number of stocks and choose specific stocks to include in the portfolio, enabling the program
to calculate the optimized weight of capital for each risky asset. The project leveraged the power of the yfinance
library to retrieve stock data, providing a robust and efficient solution for portfolio optimization.
